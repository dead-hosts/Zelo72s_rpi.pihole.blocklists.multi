# ------------------------------------------------
# Zelo*s "Multi" Blocklist - for a better internet
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# An all in one blocklist that can be used as a
# stand alone blocklist. For every region.
#
# Blocks:
#    ads, tracking, metrics, telemetry, phishing,
#    malware, coins and other "crap".
#
# This blocklist was designed to avoid false 
# positive domains as much as possible and
# not to block any needed features.
# Maximum blocking with full functionality.
#
# It was compiled from numerous sources, 
# my own blacklist and various whitelists.
# To keep the list as small as possible, 
# dead domains are removed regularly.
#
# It is updated daily and is available in
# the following formats:
#   domains, hosts and adblock.
#   See: https://github.com/Zelo72
#
# Created for purely personal, private use.
# Keep the internet clean!

# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).
Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist to have a list of only active domains or IP.

Today, we provide our infrastructure for anybody who want it. [Just ask](https://github.com/dead-hosts/dev-center/issues/new?template=inclusion-request.md)!
